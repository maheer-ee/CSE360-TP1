/**
 * ModelDeleteUser
 * ---------------
 * The model for the Delete User page.
 *
 * Right now, this model is intentionally empty because all
 * database interaction is handled directly through Database.java.
 *
 * Why keep it?
 *  - Preserves the MVC separation (View, Controller, Model).
 *  - Provides a place to add local state or business logic in the future.
 *  - Keeps structure consistent with other features of the project.

    // No local state yet. Placeholder for future expansion.
